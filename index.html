            <p>And so he proposes death as the penalty. And what shall I propose on my part, O men of Athens? Clearly 
                that which is my due. And what is that which I ought to pay or to receive? What shall be done to the man
                 who has never had the wit to be idle during his whole life; but has been careless of what the many 
                 care about - wealth, and family interests, and military offices, and speaking in the assembly, and 
                 magistracies, and plots, and parties. Reflecting that I was really too honest a man to follow in 
                 this way and live, I did not go where I could do no good to you or to myself; but where I could do 
                 the greatest good privately to everyone of you, thither I went, and sought to persuade every man 
                 among you that he must look to himself, and seek virtue and wisdom before he looks to his private 
                 interests, and look to the state before he looks to the interests of the state; and that this 
                 should be the order which he observes in all his actions. What shall be done to such a one? 
                 Doubtless some good thing, O men of Athens, if he has his reward; and the good should be of a kind 
                 suitable to him. What would be a reward suitable to a poor man who is your benefactor, who desires
                 leisure that he may instruct you? There can be no more fitting reward than maintenance in the 
                 Prytaneum, O men of Athens, a reward which he deserves far more than the citizen who has won the 
                 prize at Olympia in the horse or chariot race, whether the chariots were drawn by two horses or by 
                 many. For I am in want, and he has enough; and he only gives you the appearance of happiness, and 
                 I give you the reality. And if I am to estimate the penalty justly, I say that maintenance in the 
                 Prytaneum is the just return.</p>
